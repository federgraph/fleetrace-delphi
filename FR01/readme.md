FR01 is the easiest to use client program in the FR family of applications.

It does not use any third party components.

FR is a result program for the sport of sailing designed for sharing the original data and not the reports. The program computes the results. What you need is the program itself and original, good quality data. The same program can be used by all parties.

Once you have loaded the data of the event into the application you can carry out a what-if analyses, e.g. delete a *dnf* and enter the *fictional finish position*.

Usage Example: After race 3 you click on a button in FR01 to download the latest data, including race 2. Then you enter the finish positions of race 3. It will take less than a minute if you copy the results from the black board or via phone.
