## FR69

FR69 is the first application I am going to upload, more will follow.

- This is the full application, other family member projects will be more streamlined.
- FR69 contains too much source code, but it can give you an idea of the bigger picture.
- Note that the application can be a server, tcp and http.

In the default configuration it will open sockets,
that is why Windows will prompt you for default firewall settings.

- By default the application will create a folder in your documents dir, used for configuration text files and data text files.
- The application can serve the Angular client, the source code for it will public too.
- I am publishing FR69 as is and will clean up the project later, because I want to have the cleaned up pieces in the history.
- More to come.
