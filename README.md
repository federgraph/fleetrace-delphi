# fleetrace-delphi

This repository will contain a family of related Delphi projects side by side, so that you can compare them easily using a good merge tool. It is via the folder comparison view of that tool that you will be able to keep in control.

## FR69

FR69 is the first application I am going to upload, more will follow.

## How to build

The source code is for Delphi 10.2 (Tokyo) !

- I am using Community Edition.
- I am not using any third party components.
- It should work with Delphi 10.3 (Rio).

#### First action after opening a project for the first time

Please go to project options and restore the output directories for exe and dcus to be the original default for a new project:

```
.\$(Platform)\$(Config)
```

I have put the .dproj into gitignore.
Delphi will recreate it locally from the dpr,
but it does not restore the original-new-project-default value for the output dirs.

#### About res files

I do not want to include the normal project-name.res file (see gitignore),
so a new one will be recreated in your local repo when you compile.

- I do include the other res files,
- the resources for these will go into a separate directory
- together with the bat file to compile the rc files.
